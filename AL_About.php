	Hi!
	<br><br>
	My name is <b> Tate DeVito</b>, and I am the founder of <b>allaboard</b>
	<br>
	Growing up, I have always loved snowboarding and surfing. All along the way, 
	the thing that has stood in my way is the costly process of buying or renting equipment. 
	<br><br>
	Renting equipment was no fun and the equipment was never high quality; buying equipment was super expensive. 
	I thought it might be interesting if I tried building a platform to help both parties. 
	<br><br>
	With <b> allaboard</b>, people who have paid a lot of money for equipment can make some money back by 
	letting others use it in the offseason. The renting pool of people can test and use high 
	quality equipment from the first group! Win win. 
	<br><br>
	A board for everyone (all a board). All aboard.
