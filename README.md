Welcome! This is a web application that centralizes on surf, snowboarding, and ski equipment. My goal is to link users who want to rent out their equipment to others for a rental price they set. This can eliminate annoyances with traditional renting, and allow users who have equipment (like me) monetize equipment they may not be using all of the time. 

I have been working locally on in a XAMPP container building a PHP frontend with behaviors in JavaScript. Next steps will be figuring out hosting, customer interviews, and finishing the MySQL database.
