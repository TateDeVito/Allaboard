Welcome! This is a web application I have been working on; I am outlining classes in Java and building out the design in HTML/CSS.
The app centralizes on surf, snowboarding, and ski equipment. My goal is to link users who want to rent out their equipment to others for a rental price they set. This can eliminate annoyances with traditional renting, and allow users who have equipment (like me) monetize equipment they may not be using all of the time. Next steps are linking the Java and HTML formats, hosting, looking into cloud, and setting up a database. I'd love thoughts so far!
